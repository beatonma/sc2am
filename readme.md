# SCII Achievement Manager

`sc2am` aims to make StarCraft II achievements easier to browse.
  - Completed achievements are removed so you can decide what to focus on
    next without the clutter
  - Collapsable UI lets you show what you're interested in while hiding the rest
  - Sort by category, points, or title
