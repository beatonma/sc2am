# SCII Achievement Manager

`sc2am` aims to make StarCraft II achievements easier to browse.
  - Completed achievements are removed so you can decide what to focus on
    next without the clutter
  - Collapsable UI lets you show what you're interested in while hiding the rest
  - Sort by category, points, or title


### Translation

Data retrieved from the API is automatically localised using the locale
of the given profile. However, there are a few other bits of text on
the site that are currently only in English. If you would like to add
a translation for your language, please find the corresponding file in
`web/locales` and use the keys in `en_GB.json`. Thanks!
